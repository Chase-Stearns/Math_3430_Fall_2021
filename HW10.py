"""
For this homework you will not need to write any code. Instead you will write a
short paragraph answering the below question. You will save this paragraph in a
textfile called HW10 and upload it to your github repo.


Question 01)

Briefly describe a computing project you would find interesting to work on in
the future. This project may be

1) Implementing existing mathematics as algorithms, as we have done in this
course.

2) A simple project to learn another computing language.

3) An addition to the linear algebra package from your final project. 

4) A project to learn more complex tools in python. (Such as numpy, scipy,
pandas, machine learning packages such as tensorflow, etc...)

5) A computer application (such as a video game, art tools, music editor, etc..)

6) Any other type of project which I have failed to mention here. 


Your answer does not need to be exceptionally detailed. Just a short paragraph.

#Homework 10
"""
A computing project I would find interesting to work on is trying to create a 
computer game that is simple. I think a computer would be the easiest and the
most enjoyable to create because it would not be as difficult and time 
consuming. Video games are my biggest hobby and I believe a project like this 
would help me undertsand more about how complex the games we all know and love
truly are.

Question 01) Recently we discussed floating point arithmetic, which has become
the standard way of representing numbers on a computer. One of the key aspects
of floating point numbers is that the gap between a number and it's floating
point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. 
This differs from what is called a "fixed
point" representation, where the gap is constant. 

What is an advantage or disadvantage to using floating point instead of fixed
point?

Note: Your answer is only expected to be a short paragraph. You are not expected to
prove anything!

"""
The biggest advantage I see with using floating point instead of fixed point is
the accuracy. While on the other hand, the disadvantage of using a floating 
point number is the amount of storage required to store the number.
